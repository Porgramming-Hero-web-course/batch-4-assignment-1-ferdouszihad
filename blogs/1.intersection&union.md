union and intersection types have most significant purpose of type validation and create another type based on data architecture </hr>

### Purpose

- Union and Intersection types provide the flexibility to define more precise types, allow developers to create real-world complex structure.
- union type allows a variable to hold values of multiple types. It’s defined using the "|" symbol. It is useful to create variables can accept several valid types.
- intersection type combines multiple types into one. It’s defined using the "&" symbol. This is useful when an entity needs to meet the requirements of multiple types

```ts
//union type
type Circle = {
  shape: "circle";
  radius: number;
};
type Rectangle = {
  shape: "rectangle";
  height: number;
  width: number;
};

type Shape = Circle | Rectangle;
```

```ts
//Intersection type
type student = {
  name: string;
  roll: number;
};
type result = {
  roll: number;
  totalMark: number;
};

type resultSheet = student & result;
```
